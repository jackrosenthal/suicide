The Suicide Programming Language
================================

.. note::

   This programming language was made for a competition as a
   joke. Nobody was harmed in the creation of this programming
   language.

The suicide programming language is an esoteric programming language focused
around birth, having kids, murdering your family, then killing yourself.
There's a caveat tho: all of your children must do exactly as you did, with the
only data being set to them is what is left on the stack. And, your children
run concurrently at the same time as you, and you aren't guarunteed when
exactly they will do things.

See the example code for examples in the language.
